# Tempature Sensor
This builds a temperature reader with teh adafruit [SHT40 reader](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-sht40-temperature-humidity-sensor). This is basic setup which provides terminal readout from the sensor.  

## Node MCU Setup With Micropython
This article provides a nice summary of setting up NodeMCU with micropython.  This should work for blank NodeMCU or one with material already.  https://www.embedded-robotics.com/esp8266-micropython/.  

This provides very good setup and I suggest using Thonny app for develompent.  https://www.embedded-robotics.com/esp8266-micropython/

## ???

To start, I am setting up the NodeMCU with fresh micropython.  I am going to use 
[this reference](https://icircuit.net/nodemcu-getting-started-micropython/2406) to to complete the setup. My setup is on Linux, so here is some helpful howtos on setup:

- how to check drivers on linux `ls /dev/tty*`
- https://www.embedded-robotics.com/esp8266-micropython/
- use `esptool` to flash the board (https://blog.anavi.technology/?p=209)
- to interact with the controller through the usb, get the ampy tool. This is detailed out here https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/projects/micropython-basics-load-files-run-code/fb1fcedaf11e4547943abfdd8ad825ce but can be installed with pip with `pip install adafruit-ampy --upgrade`.  Useful commands are:
  - ls /dev/tty* 
  - ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 ls
