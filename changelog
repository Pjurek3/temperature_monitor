V0.0.5
* added deep sleep to boot to control when we don't have wifi
* removed code to write to text file since this was causing issues (too much memory)
* moved internet check to main from boot.  This is because otherwise, we would never be able to boot unless we were on registered wifi.
* added pin 14 disconnect to repl.  This allows nodemcu to skip program and go right to repl for dev.  
* added watchdog timer (built in) around sensor reading and http requests to reset when it gets hung

V0.0.4 - minor
* updated secrets back to secrets.py.  Didn't like app_secrets.py.

* added connection to adafruit IO
* added process which cycles the temp reading
* built out adafruit io interface
